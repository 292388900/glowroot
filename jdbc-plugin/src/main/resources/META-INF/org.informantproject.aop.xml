      sql server jdbc driver is signed so weaving it fails, first with a warning:

      warning define generated class failed
      java.lang.SecurityException:
      class "com.microsoft.sqlserver.jdbc.SQLServerConnection$AjcClosure1"'s signer
      information does not match signer information of other classes in the same package

      and then with a fatal error:

      java.lang.NoClassDefFoundError: com/microsoft/sqlserver/jdbc/SQLServerConnection$AjcClosure3

      weaving sql server jdbc isn't needed anyways since Informant weaves calls to the driver
      instead of the executions of method bodies inside the driver (a small but significant
      difference)
