          When enabled, all methods that are woven for metric timing are renamed with suffix
          <code>$informant$metric$&lt;metric name&gt;</code>
          and a new method is generated in its place that simply calls the renamed method. The purpose of this is so
          that stack traces gathered by the profiler can see what metric timings are active, and the resulting trace
          profiles can be filtered in the UI by metric names. For example, a trace profile can be filtered to see only
          the profile of code that is executing jdbc queries. Or, even more useful, filter to see only the profile of
          code that has no metric timings, which helps to discover new bottlenecks that would be worth timing via
          pointcuts. <em>Changes to this setting will take effect on next JVM restart.</em>

          When enabled, a warning will be logged when a span is encountered outside of a trace. For example, if a jdbc
          query is executed by a background task outside of a servlet. This can be helpful for finding background tasks
          that should be captured as traces via pointcuts.
