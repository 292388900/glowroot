          Maximum number of spans collected for a given trace. This is useful for
          limiting the memory requirement of very very long traces that capture
          potentially hundreds of thousands of spans (e.g. large batch or background
          operations).
          Also, the ui is not really optimized for viewing super large numbers of
          spans.
